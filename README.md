I believe ComplexHeatmap is perhaps the best package for visualizing heatmaps, offering a wide range of options for adding amazing annotations.

Here is an example, which can be made much more complex if desired.

Make sure to maintain the correct order of genes and samples in the annotation files, as this is the most important and tricky part.

Note: This is randomly generated data, allowing you to see the structure of the data for yourself.

Enjoy it!
